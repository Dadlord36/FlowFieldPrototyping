Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture provided by Bevy. It showcases basic functionalities such as:

- Spawning and controlling multiple entities representing crowd members.
- Implementing simple movement behaviors like flocking or following a leader.
- Handling collisions and interactions between crowd members.

**Features**

- Entity Management: Easily manage and manipulate entities representing crowd members.
- Movement Behaviors: Experiment with different movement algorithms to simulate crowd behaviors.
- Collision Handling: Detect and respond to collisions between crowd members or with obstacles.
- Customization: Extend and customize the prototype to fit your specific crowd simulation needs.
